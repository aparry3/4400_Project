# 4400_Project
Final Heavyweight Project for CS 4400

Doesn't look nice yet, but is mostly functional,

TO RUN:
1. Clone repo
2. Navigate to directory
3. run `npm install` to install node dependencies
4. Run `npm start` to start server
5. Open browser and navigate to "localhost:3000/#/login"


NOTE: Must have MySQL installed and set up a database of the corrct tables.
    I might add the db setup scripts later, probably not tbh.
